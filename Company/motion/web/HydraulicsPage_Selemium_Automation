# This selenium script was created by Jim ORourke on 7/3/2023
# It is only for FYI Purposes only and to showcase Automation abilities to potiential employers
# This script uses the Motion.com website as its bases. It is non descrutive meaning it does not add anything
# to a shopping cart or register any users it is only for informational purposes only and can be used by anybody for that sole purpose

# How it works: Do you need to figure out a way to scroll in selenium. Check out Step 2
# The test case that this automation script was built off of is included at the bottom of this script
# Just match up the Step number comments in the script to the test case number in the comments section at the bottom of this script
# Also, check out the YouTube channel 369TechMedia @369TechMedia for additional testing information and you will even get to see my ugly mug. Can't say you haven't been warned :)
# The Mobile script of this test case can be located in the \Motions\ folder in the Github repository where this script was located.
# Happy Testing all

# This selenium script was created in OS Win 11, Intelli J, Python, Selenium
